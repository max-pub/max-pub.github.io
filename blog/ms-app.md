Why Microsoft should expand their App-Platform
Microsoft did a great job in creating an common App-Platform for its ecosystem of Windows-Devices. They fell short, however, of creating platform-spanning true Universal Apps. I’d argue that it makes sense for them to do just that.
Imagine an e
Given that Windows-Apps are still an afterthought for most developers I understand Microsoft’s decision even less. They are trying converters as a way to bring iOS and Android apps to windows as second-class citizens. I’m sure that way won’t work.
Instead they should focus on creating universal apps that run across all major operating systems, maybe with a better experience on Windows than elsewhere. And I think this would be fairly easy to achieve. They’d just have to build packagable runtimes of their existing “Windows Universal Apps” for Mac, iOS & Android and automate the AppStore-Distribution. The necessary pieces even already exist in projects like PhoneGap & MacGap.
Just give developers one API to develop and one distribution center to automatically publish to all major app stores. The holy grail of app-development, it can be achieved. And I’m sure that no other company is better positioned to create this and has more to gain by it than Microsoft in its current state.
Go Microsoft, this is the path to attract developers and ultimately succeed with your ecosystem.
