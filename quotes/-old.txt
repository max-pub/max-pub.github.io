All the people we used to know
They’re an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenters’ wives
Don’t know how it all got started

But me, I’m still on the road
Headin’ for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point of view
- Bob Dylan - Tangled Up In Blue
