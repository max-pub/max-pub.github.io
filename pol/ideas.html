        <h3>Self-sufficient government departments</h3>
        <p>
            Splitting executive power into stand-alone departments, indepently elected for a number of years, is a new form of power-separation. It removes some layers of political management and therefore shortens decision-paths. At the same time can no single person

        <h3>Citizen Tax</h3>
        <p>
            People give parts of their income to the government in almost every country. That money is then mixed up and used for various purposes. Why not let people themselves decide how to spend that money?

        <p>
            Cleaning bathrooms is one of the most strenouus tasks of house-keeping. And it could be so much easier! What about a fully water-resistant teflon-coated bathroom with a sink and water nozzles in the roof? The room could be cleaned with the push of a button!

        <h3>Owning of Marketplaces</h3>
        <p>
            One of the greatest economic promises of the internet was to facilitate transactions and create more perfect, better informed markets. That promise was partly delivered. It is now easier than ever to exchange information. But it could be far better still! The newly created markets tend to shield the information that was freely given to them ebay.com, craigslist.com, mitfahrgelegenheit.de, willhaben.at facebook.com is probably the one exception to the rule.

            Acedia (=Sloth) is one of the deadly sins. And for good reason I guess. It seems to me that this is the number one reason for the problems in our world. Why this ignorance and disrespect towards your fellows? Try to be mindful, everyday.

            How about a politically coloured map with a time-slider? You could follow the rise and fall of empires with the touch of a button. This would make understanding geopolitics and history so much easier!

        <p>
            Companies have habit of tricking consumers into long-term-contracts. The benefits to them are as obvious as are the downsides for consumers. There should at least be enforced monthly cancelation policies.

        <h3>Base Income vs Base Service</h3>

            There is so much discussion about if or how a basic income guarantee could work. How about a Base Service instead? Giving not only free medical care, but also free food and shelter to all our citizens. That seems to be the society of the future to me.
